# Flask Application

This is a Flask application that contains different pages, combined with tools that i have been using on some of my work, this is still in development.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/npbjr/mytools.git
cd tools


2. Create a Virtual Environment
Create a virtual environment using venv:

bash
python -m venv venv
3. Activate the Virtual Environment
On Windows:

bash
venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:

bash
source venv/bin/activate

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

bash
python flask_app.py

The application should now be running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
